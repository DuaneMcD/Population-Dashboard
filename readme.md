# Population-Dashboard

### Python population dashboard built with hvplot and jupyter lab.

This project vizualizes global population data from 1980 - 2013.
The data used is from CORGIS: The Collection of Really Great, Interesting, Situated Datasets.
The csv was imported and sanitized with pandas into an interactive dataframe.

The dashboard is built with Hvplot for the graphs and data display, and Holoviz Panel is used for the user facing dashboard.

The settings on the left side allow for year selection and to choose between male, female or total life expectancy. The charts update to the given selections.
